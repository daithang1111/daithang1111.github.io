I start this blog to share interesting issues that I experience while conducting research.

## Try to write some math equation

Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

+ Now let's try a more complicated example: \\( \frac{y}{x} = \sigma*\lambda \\). And also more.
```javascript
//Example on math
\\( x = \frac{y}{z}\\).
```

* The end.
